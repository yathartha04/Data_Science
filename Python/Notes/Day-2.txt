IDE-Integrated development language (VScode)
PascalCase-used to define class
camelCase-used to define function

append()- adds the element at the end of the list
count()-counts the no. of element of the list
index()-returns the index of the element
indexing-always starts from 0, print(variable[index number])
slicing-creates a new subset list from the original list(the end value is always exclusive) 0 this is start index num:9 this is end index num
